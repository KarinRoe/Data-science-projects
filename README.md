# Data Science projects

In the data science projects I analyse interesting datasets to practise my python coding and analysis skills.

1. **Identifying Profitable App Profiles**- In this project I used no data science libraries, such as pandas, to learn and practise the basic synthax of Python. I used loops and created my own functions to analyse the two data sets. 
2. **Hacker News Comments**- In this project I still focused on the basics of python and used the datetime library to convert and use dates and times.
