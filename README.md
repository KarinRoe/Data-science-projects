# Data Science projects

In the data science projects I analyse interesting datasets to practise my python coding and analysis skills.

1. **Identifying Profitable App Profiles**- In this project I used no data science libraries, such as pandas, to learn and practise the basic synthax of Python. I used loops and created my own functions to analyse the two data sets. 
2. **Hacker News Comments**- In this project I still focused on the basics of python and used the datetime library to convert and use dates and times.
3. **Visualizing The Gender Gap in College Degrees**- In this project I am using matplotlib to make multible charts to show the Gender Gap in College Degrees. Also using **Color Blind 10** from [Tableau](http://tableaufriction.blogspot.com/2012/11/finally-you-can-use-tableau-data-colors.html) for colors that work with people who have colorblindness. 
4. **Visualizing Geographical data with basemap**- Here I visualize Airport data with the help of the library basemap.
5. **Analysing CIA Factbook data using SQLite and Python** - In this project I am analysing the CIA Factbook data about countries with help of SQLite and Python.
6. **Online music store data analysis with SQLite** - Analysing music data from an fictional online music store with SQLite and Python. 
7. **Finding the best markets to advertise** - Analysing survey data from new coders to see which market would be best to advertise.
8. **Probabilities to win the lottery** - Various function to display the unlikeliness to win the lottery.
